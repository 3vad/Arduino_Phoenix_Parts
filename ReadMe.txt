Warning, this is a Work In Progress!  There are no warrantees or Guarantees of any type that this code is useable for anything.  But I hope it is…

This set of directories are my latest attempt of breaking up the Phoenix code base for the Arduino, into libraries that you can use to build different builds for many different hexapods…  Most of the code in these libraries are in header files, which allows them to be compiled specifically for each project.   

Hopefully soon, I will update this readme with more instructions on how to configure these to do different things.  To use this code you need to copy each of the included directories into your Arduino Library directory.  I personally use the User library directory, which is located some place like: <Your User>\My Documents\Arduino\libraries.

In the Phoenix library there are several examples of configurations.  Once these directories are installed, you can simply go to the file menu, look in the Examples menu item, and hopefully in this list will be Phoenix and under this are several configrations…

Good Luck
